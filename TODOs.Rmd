# TODO

## Structure

-   Move filter logic to shared files
-   Potentially revamp visualization to shared files

## Analysis / Visualization

-   Add "vs other teams" and "vs general pickrates" to map analysis visualization
-   Recreate team analysis to act as a team dashboard (team preferences, notable hero preferences, overall team stats) since map and team analysis page essentially have the same function right now, just with map analysis having more filters
-   Add interactions page to analyse hero interactions (good and bad matchups)
